Movie Review Club

The Movie Review Club is a website that brings people together to watch and review movies. The users of the website can contribute to the creation of a database of movies for review by adding movies, including using The Movie Database (TMDB) API to locate details such as the release date and overview of the movie plot.
The Administrator of the Movie Review Club edits the movie details to assign a review date for the movie and URLs for streaming services from which they can use to watch the movie on the review date.
On the review date, the movie review comment input button becomes available based on a date check, and users can contribute their comments and reviews of the movie, and engage in a discussion about the movie.
The Administrator can perform the additional tasks of adding and removing movie categories, users can delete their own comments, and Administrators can delete any inappropriate comments submitted by users.


UX

The website is for movie lovers who enjoy engaging in discussion and debate about the movies they watch.
This website presents information using a simple and easy to understand set of web pages that are easy to navigate.
The information provided is clear and to the point, with colourful, simple colours and graphics used to illustrate the information being provided.
The website has been developed in a manner ensuring it can be easily read on multiple device types including computer screens, tablets and mobile phones. This ensures the website audience can access the information presented in many ways, for example, while at a computer in an office or on a mobile phone using wifi.
